# Car Rental

This C++ project was developed as a semester project for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The primary objective was to apply and reinforce OOP concepts while also delving into memory management techniques and exploring GUI development using the Qt framework.

## Features:
- *Add Car*: Allows users to add a new car to the rental system.
- *Display Cars*: Displays all cars currently available for rent.
- *Filter*: Enables users to filter cars based on specific criteria.
- *Delete Car*: Allows users to remove a car from the rental system.
- *Modify License Plate*: Enables users to change the license plate number of a car.
- *Dynamic Buttons*: Provide intuitive interactions with individual car models in the system.
- *UNDO*: Allows users to undo the last action performed.
- *Report*: Generates reports on various aspects of the car rental system, including:
  - Exporting the list of cars in tabular form to an HTML file.
  - Exporting the list of cars to a CSV file.
 
## Technical details:
- *Memory Management*: The project demonstrates strong knowledge of memory management principles such as the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), handling memory leaks, and dealing with dangling pointers.
- *Custom Vector Implementation*: Includes a custom implementation of a small part of the vector class from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), utilizing concepts like iterators, templates, and more.
- *Design Patterns*: Incorporates design patterns such as Observer and Model-View-Controller (MVC) to structure and organize the codebase effectively.
- *GUI Development with Qt*: Explores graphical user interface development using the Qt framework, including concepts like signals, slots, and event-driven programming.
